## Welcome

The uniquely human abilities to read and write are essential skills in modern life. These skills require years of training to master and, due to dyslexia or dysgraphia, many people struggle to reach the level of fluency many people take for granted. My research seeks to better understand the brain basis of how we are able to understand and produce written words, and how our brains change as we incorporate new words into our lexicon. I use human intracranial recordings and direct cortical stimulation in large patient cohorts to create high spatiotemporal resolution maps of literacy in the brain, directly linking brain activity to behaviour.
