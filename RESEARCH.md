## Research
My research utilises intracranial recordings to investigate the neural representations that underpin our ability to read. The high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings allows us to track the dynamic spread of information across the cortical surface, the interactions between multiple functional hubs, and the representation of the statistical properties of language that govern our reading speed. By using direct cortical stimulation through the same electrodes, we can also produce transient disruptions of function allowing a causal link to behavior.

### Visual Word Processing
To recognise a word we must convert from a combination of visual lines on the retina into an invariant representation of letters, and then link this to an object in our internal dictionary. This process involves dynamic, recurrent feed-forward and feedback interactions within the visual stream. This also includes interactions with regions outside the visual stream to determine the correct meaning and pronunciation and allow us to read aloud.

### Sentence Comprehension
Reading a sentence requires an interface between the visual and language systems. The meaning and structural organisation of individual words when they are combined into phrases and sentences allows us to derive more complex meaning. How do we build hierarchical structures from these word combinations? How do we abstract out from the meanings of individual words to the meaning of an entire sentence?

### Learning and Memory
Even as adults our vocabulary is not static and our reading network must be plastic to enable us to learn new words. What is the progression of neural changes that occur as we incorporate new words into our vocabulary? How do we create new associations between novel words and their sounds and meanings? How do we retrieve the names of unique entities (e.g. people and places) and how does this differ from naming generic, common objects?
