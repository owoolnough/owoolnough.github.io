## Research
My research utilises high spatiotemporal resolution intracranial recordings to track the dynamic neural representations that underpin our ability to read.

### Visual Word Processing
![Neural activity while reading aloud](/assets/img/ReadingVideo.gif) To recognise a word we must convert from a combination of visual lines on the retina into an invariant representation of letters, and then link this to an object in our internal dictionary. This process involves dynamic, recurrent feed-forward and feedback interactions within the visual stream. This also includes interactions with regions outside the visual stream to determine the correct meaning and pronunciation.

### Sentence Comprehension
Reading a sentence requires an interface between the visual and language systems. The meaning and structural organisation of individual words when they are combined into phrases and sentences allows us to derive more complex meaning.

### Learning and Memory
My research investigates the interface between the visual and memory systems. How do we incorporate new words into our vocabulary? How do we create new associations between novel visual word forms and their sounds and meanings? How do we retrieve the names of unique entities (e.g. people and places) and how does this differ from naming generic, common objects?
